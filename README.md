# landing-page

Hello, this is the landing-page project for the TOP curriculum that I am currently studying. The premise for this project is to recreate a simple web-page-layout using only the reference image. I will be working on my knowledge of basic CSS and HTML and using my information gathering skills to complete this assignment.

My goals for this project are:
1. Breaking a large problem down to smaller manageable pieces.
2. Analyzing those pieces using my current set of skills.
3. Not being discouraged by hardship that I will face along the way.
